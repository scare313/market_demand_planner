# 📦 Master Inventory Planner (Multi-Channel)

An intelligent inventory forecasting tool designed for e-commerce sellers managing **Amazon, Flipkart, and Meesho**. It unifies sales data from multiple platforms, converts packs into base units, and calculates precise replenishment needs based on sales velocity.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Multi-Channel Aggregation:** Merges sales reports from Amazon (CSV), Flipkart (Excel), and Meesho (CSV) into a single view.
    
-   **Smart Unit Conversion:** Automatically detects "Pack of 4" or "Pack of 2" from SKUs and calculates demand for the _Base Unit_ (Internal SKU).
    
-   **Velocity-Based Forecasting:** Calculates Average Daily Sales (ADS) to recommend purchase quantities.
    
-   **Customizable Logic:** Adjust Lead Time, Safety Stock, and Purchase Period on the fly.
    
-   **Orphan Detection:** Identifies new SKUs sold that are missing from your Master Catalog.

## 📊 The Math Behind It

The tool uses a standard Reorder Point formula:

1.  **ADS (Average Daily Sales):** `Total Base Units Sold / Sales Days`
    
2.  **Safety Stock:** `ADS * Safety Stock Days`
    
3.  **Lead Time Demand:** `ADS * Lead Time Days`
    
4.  **Cycle Stock:** `ADS * Days to Cover`
    
5.  **Recommended Qty:** `Cycle Stock + Safety Stock + Lead Time Demand`
